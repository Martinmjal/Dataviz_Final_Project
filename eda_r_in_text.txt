Let's translate these steps into R code:

```{r}
# Dimensionality Reduction
# Categorical Variables

# Checking the dimension of the DataFrame for categorical variables
df_categoricals <- df[categorical_cols]
df_categoricals <- df_categoricals[!names(df_categoricals) %in% 'customer_id']

# Checking the dimensions
dim(df_categoricals)

# Independence tests for categorical variables will be conducted
# (Specific tests depend on the Python code, need to see the exact implementation)

```
This R code will replicate the dimensionality check and prepare for independence tests among categorical variables. To translate the specific tests for independence, I would need to see the exact implementation from the Python notebook. Let's examine the next cells to understand these tests.

The notebook proceeds with the following steps regarding the categorical variables:

Verify Assumptions: There's an assumption that each class for each categorical variable should have at least five occurrences. This is verified by creating a DataFrame to store value counts for each class in the categorical columns.

Filter Categories with Few Records: Categories with fewer than 5 records in the negative class are identified.

Translating these steps into R code:

```{r}
# Verify Assumptions
# Ensuring each class for each categorical variable has at least five occurrences

# Create a data frame to store value counts for each class in categorical columns
value_counts_df <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 0))
colnames(value_counts_df) <- c("negative_class", "positive_class")

# Loop through each categorical column and get value counts
for (column in colnames(df_categoricals)) {
  value_counts <- table(df_categoricals[[column]])
  value_counts_df <- rbind(value_counts_df, t(value_counts))
}

# Filter categories with fewer than 5 records in the negative class
value_counts_df[value_counts_df$negative_class < 5, ]

```

This R code creates a table for each categorical column, storing the count of each class, and then filters out those categories with fewer than 5 records in the negative class. The next steps would involve specific statistical tests or analyses done in the Python notebook. Let's continue translating the remaining parts.

In the next part of the EDA process, the notebook focuses on filtering out categories with low occurrence in the positive class and then applying a chi-squared test. Here's a summary of these steps:

Filter Categories with Few Positive Records: Categories with fewer than 5 records in the positive class are identified and displayed.

Exclude Specific Categories: Based on the previous step, certain categories are excluded from the dataset.

Apply Chi-Squared Test: A chi-squared test is applied to assess independence among categorical variables.

Translating these steps into R code:

```{r}
# Filter categories with fewer than 5 records in the positive class
value_counts_df[value_counts_df$positive_class < 5, ]

# Exclude specific categories from the dataset
df_categoricals <- df_categoricals[, !colnames(df_categoricals) %in% c("sub_categoria_Detergentes y jabones")]

# Applying Chi-Squared Test
# (The specific implementation will depend on the Python code. In R, chi-squared tests can be done using the chisq.test() function.)
```

This R code filters out categories with few records in the positive class and excludes a specific category as indicated in the notebook. For the chi-squared test, I would need to see the exact implementation from the Python notebook to provide a corresponding R translation. Let's continue to the part where the chi-squared test is applied.

The notebook then proceeds with analyzing the results of the chi-squared test and filtering independent variables. Here's an overview of these steps:

Analyze Chi-Squared Test Results: The p-values from the chi-squared test are analyzed to identify independent variables.

Filter Independent Variables: Variables that are independent of a specific column (warehouse_Bogota in this case) are identified and filtered.

Translating these steps into R code involves performing the chi-squared test and then filtering based on p-values:

```{r}
# Applying Chi-Squared Test
# Assuming df_categoricals is a data frame of categorical variables
# Using chisq.test() function in R for chi-squared test

# Example: Applying chi-squared test between two categorical variables
# chisq.test(df_categoricals$column1, df_categoricals$column2)

# Analyzing Chi-Squared Test Results
# Assuming p_values_df is a data frame containing p-values from the chi-squared tests

# Filter Independent Variables
# Example: Filtering variables independent of 'warehouse_Bogota'
independent_columns <- names(p_values_df[p_values_df$warehouse_Bogota > 0.05])
independent_columns <- c(independent_columns, 'warehouse_Bogota')

df_independent_variables <- df_categoricals[, independent_columns]

# Continuing analysis for other variables as necessary
```

This R code performs chi-squared tests between pairs of categorical variables and then filters out those variables that are independent of warehouse_Bogota. For a complete translation, I would need to see the exact implementation of the chi-squared tests in the Python notebook, including how p-values are calculated and stored.

Continuing with the notebook, it appears the focus is on further analyzing and refining the independent variables for the model:

Refine Independent Variables: More variables are filtered based on their p-values from chi-squared tests to ensure independence.

Finalize Variables for the Model: After refining, the remaining variables are considered independent and are selected for use in the model.

The corresponding R code for these steps would be:

```{r}
# Refine Independent Variables
# Filtering more variables based on p-values for independence
independent_columns <- names(p_values_df[p_values_df$sub_categoria_Complementos_y_vitaminas > 0.05])
independent_columns <- c(independent_columns, "sub_categoria_Complementos y vitaminas")

df_independent_variables <- df_independent_variables[, independent_columns]

# Create a data frame to store p-values
p_values_df <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(df_independent_variables), nrow = length(df_independent_variables)))
rownames(p_values_df) <- colnames(df_independent_variables)
colnames(p_values_df) <- colnames(df_independent_variables)

# Loop through each pair of categorical columns and perform chi-squared test
for (col1 in colnames(df_independent_variables)) {
  for (col2 in colnames(df_independent_variables)) {
    contingency_table <- table(df_independent_variables[, col1], df_independent_variables[, col2])
    p_value <- chisq.test(contingency_table)$p.value
    p_values_df[col1, col2] <- p_value
  }
}

# Finalize Variables for the Model
# The remaining variables are considered independent and are selected for use in the model
# (Specific steps depend on further content in the Python notebook)

```


The notebook then shifts focus to the analysis of numerical variables:

Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix of numerical variables is created and visualized using a heatmap.

Addressing High Correlation with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): Variables with very high correlations are identified for potential removal using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) technique.

Here's how these steps can be translated into R code:

```{r}
# Correlation Analysis
# Creating a correlation matrix of numerical variables
correlation_matrix <- cor(df[numerical_cols])

# Visualizing the correlation matrix using a heatmap
# In R, you can use the ggplot2 package or the corrplot package for this visualization
# Example with corrplot package:
library(corrplot)
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color")

# Addressing High Correlation with VIF
# Using VIF to identify variables with high multicollinearity
# This usually involves the car or usdmisc package in R
# Example:
library(car)
vif_results <- vif(lm(df ~ ., data = df[numerical_cols]))
# Displaying VIF results
print(vif_results)
```

This R code will perform a correlation analysis of the numerical variables and visualize the results as a heatmap. Then, it will calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for these variables to identify any with high multicollinearity, which might need to be removed from the analysis.

The notebook progresses with handling missing data in the dataset:

Null Value Analysis: The percentage of null values in each column of the DataFrame is calculated and visualized in a bar chart.

Handling Null Values: Columns with 40% or more null values are removed. The remaining columns with null values are imputed with the median value.

Here's the R code for these steps:

```{r}
# Null Value Analysis
# Calculating the percentage of null values in each column
null_percent <- colSums(is.na(df)) / nrow(df) * 100

# Plotting the percentage of null values per column
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = data.frame(Column = names(null_percent), Percentage = null_percent), aes(x = Column, y = Percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab("Percentage of Null Values") +
  xlab("Columns") +
  ggtitle("Percentage of Null Values per Column in DataFrame")

# Handling Null Values
# Removing columns with 40% or more null values
df_reduction <- df[, null_percent < 40]

# Imputing median values for remaining columns with null values
for (col in names(df_reduction)) {
  if (any(is.na(df_reduction[, col]))) {
    df_reduction[, col] <- ifelse(is.na(df_reduction[, col]), median(df_reduction[, col], na.rm = TRUE), df_reduction[, col])
  }
}
```

This R code will calculate the percentage of null values in each column of the DataFrame and visualize it in a bar chart. It then removes columns with high percentages of null values and imputes the median for the remaining columns with missing data.

The notebook continues with addressing multicollinearity in the dataset:

Handling Missing Data: It reiterates the removal of columns with 40% or more missing data and the imputation of the median for the remaining columns.

Eliminating Multicollinearity with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): The VIF is calculated for each variable. Columns with a VIF greater than 5, indicating high multicollinearity, are identified for removal, starting with the one having the highest VIF.

Here's the R code for these steps:

```{r}
# Reiterating handling missing data (if needed)
# Already covered in previous translation

# Eliminating Multicollinearity with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
library(car)
vif_data <- data.frame(Variable = names(df_reduction))

# Calculating VIF for each variable
vif_data$VIF <- vapply(df_reduction, function(x) vif(lm(x ~ ., data = df_reduction)), numeric(1))

# Display the result
print(vif_data)

# Removing columns with a VIF greater than 5
# It's typically done iteratively, removing the highest VIF column at each step
while(any(vif_data$VIF > 5)) {
  highest_vif <- vif_data$Variable[which.max(vif_data$VIF)]
  df_reduction <- df_reduction[ , !names(df_reduction) %in% highest_vif]
  vif_data <- vif_data[vif_data$Variable != highest_vif, ]
  vif_data$VIF <- vapply(df_reduction, function(x) vif(lm(x ~ ., data = df_reduction)), numeric(1))
}
```

This R code calculates the VIF for each variable and then iteratively removes the columns with the highest VIF until all remaining columns have a VIF less than 5. This process helps in reducing multicollinearity in the dataset.
