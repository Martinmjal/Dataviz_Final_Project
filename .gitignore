# Ignore all CSV files
*.csv

# If you want to include CSV files from other directories and only exclude them from specific ones, you can do this:
# Exclude CSV files only from the 'Project In R' and 'Project in Python' directories
Project In R/*.csv
Project in Python/*.csv

# Exclude CSV files from the 'docs' directory if they exist there
docs/*.csv

# Exclude CSV files from any subdirectories within 'Project In R' and 'Project in Python'
Project In R/**/*.csv
Project in Python/**/*.csv
